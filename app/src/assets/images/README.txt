image file naming:

target-hit-x1.png :   The original png, with all exterior white space cropped out
target-hit-x9.png :   Artificial border on all 4 sides has been added using online image tool.  x9 means that the image now occupies 1/9 of the width of the total png.
target-hit-x9-2000.png :  Finally, the image is reduced to 2000 pixels using Preview.  Tools>adjust sizing.  2000 seems to be a good compromise:  Doesn't take too long to load, isn't too blurry.


 Currently, the CROSSHAIRS images are just presented in their original sizing.
 I may want to refine this in the future.
 Also, the panel version of crosshairs is a completely different png from the crosshairs that appear when you touch the screen.
